<b>Branch: </b> <p> Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time.
</p><br><br>

<b>Clone: </b> <p>You can clone a repository from GitHub.com to your local computer, or to a codespace, to make it easier to fix merge conflicts, add or remove files, and push larger commits. When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine</p> <br><br>

<b>Commit: </b><p>You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits.Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.</p><br><br>

<b>Fetch: </b><p>Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches.</p><br><br>

<b>GIT: </b><p>The version control software that GitHub is built on</p><br><br>

<b>Github: </b><p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.</p><br><br>

<b>Merge: </b><p>After you merge your pull request, the changes on your readme-edits branch will be incorporated into main.
</p><br><br>

<b>Merge Conflict: </b><p>Sometimes, a pull request may introduce changes to code that conflict with the existing code on main. If there are any conflicts, GitHub will alert you about the conflicting code and prevent merging until the conflicts are resolved. You can make a commit that resolves the conflicts or use comments in the pull request to discuss the conflicts with your team members.</p><br><br>

<b>Push: </b><p>When you make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
</p><br><br>

<b>Pull: </b><p>Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.</p><br><br>

<b>Remote: </b><p>A remote URL is Git's fancy way of saying "the place where your code is stored." That URL could be your repository on GitHub, or another user's fork, or even on a completely different server.</p><br><br>

<b>Repository: </b><p>A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project. It can also be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.</p><br><br>
